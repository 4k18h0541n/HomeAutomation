Home Automation using  ESP8266 ESP-12E Development Board 



Introduction:

This is a home automation project and a part of IOT project using ESP8266 ESP-12E development  board. You can use this project for residential extension of building automation and involves the control and automation of lighting, heating, ventilation, air conditioning , appliances, and security. This systems  consist of switches connected to a central hub sometimes called a "gateway" from which the system is controlled with a user interface that is interacted mobile phone , tablet computer or a web interface.

Equipment :
ESP8266 ESP-12E Development Board, Relay module, Some jumper wires female connectors on the end, Standard USB data cable for uploading code and power  the board.

Preparing  ARDUINO IDE:

1.Connect USB-Serial cable 
2.Install the Arduino IDE 1.6.4 or greater
3.Install the ESP8266 Board Package Enter 
http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
into Additional Board Manager URLs field in the Arduino v1.6.4+ preference
 
4. Next, use the Board manager to install the ESP8266 package. 
5 Select  NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module) from the Tools->Board dropdown.
6. 80 MHz as the CPU frequency
7. 7. 115200 baud upload speed
 
Now it’s ready. For Your kind information ,hold flash + hold reset then release flash and then release reset makes the hardware’s firmware  clean  and ready to up a code.
